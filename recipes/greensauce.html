    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prep the Ingredients:</strong> Wash and dry the spinach and kale thoroughly. Remove any tough stems from the kale.</li>
        <li><strong>Blanch the Greens:</strong> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spinach and kale and cook for 1-2 minutes until bright green and softened.</li>
        <li><strong>Blend the Sauce:</strong> In a blender or food processor, combine the blanched spinach, kale, raw cashews, Parmesan cheese, garlic, and a splash of chicken or bone broth. Blend until smooth, scraping down the sides as needed. Add more broth, little by little, until the sauce reaches your desired consistency.</li>
        <li><strong>Season:</strong>Add salt, pepper, and optional red pepper flakes to taste. Blend briefly to combine.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Cream (Optional):</strong>If using cream, drizzle it into the blender and pulse a few times until incorporated for a richer sauce.</li>
        <li><strong>Taste and Adjust:</strong>Taste the sauce and adjust seasoning as needed. Add more Parmesan for nuttiness, broth for thinning, or garlic for more kick.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong>Use immediately as a pasta sauce, topping for meats and vegetables, or as a dip.</li>
        <li><strong>Store:</strong>Transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 3-4 days. For longer storage, freeze the sauce in small portions.</li>
