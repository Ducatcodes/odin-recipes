        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong>
                    Preheat your oven to 400째F (200째C). Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or lightly grease it.</li>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Vegetables:</strong> 
                    Wash and finely grate the carrots, zucchini, and onion. Use a clean kitchen towel or paper towels to gently squeeze out excess moisture from the grated zucchini and onion to prevent the meatballs from becoming too wet.</li>
            <li><strong>Mix the Ingredients:</strong>
                    In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground beef, ground pork, breadcrumbs, eggs, grated vegetables (carrots, zucchini, and onion), salt, pepper, and chopped parsley. Mix everything throughly with clean hands (avoid overmixing as it can make them dense)</li>
            <li><strong>Shape the Meatballs:</strong>
                    Roll the mixture into meatballs about 1 1/2 inches in diameter (or your preferred size). Place the meatballs on the prepared baking sheet, spacing them slightly apart.</li>
            <li><strong>Bake the Meatballs:</strong>
                    Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the meatballs are cooked through (internal temperature should reach 160째F/71째C for pork and beef). If desired flip halfway to make all sides crispy.</li>
            <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong>
                Remove the meatballs from the oven and let them cool slightly. Serve immediately with your favorite marinara sauce, over pasta, or as part of meal prep.</li>
